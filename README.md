# SceneryShield
SceneryShield is a DRM and encryption tool for MSFS scenery developers. It protects paid assets with secure encryption, license validation, and traceable fingerprints—letting creators control distribution, deter piracy, and track usage without disrupting user experience.

Currently a work in progress. Estimated release: February 2026.
